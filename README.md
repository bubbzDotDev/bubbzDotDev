### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on a few projects, both using Vue. One is a web app for the Bulletheads gaming community and the other is a full-stack web dashboard for Announcement Bot users.<br>
✨ My first side project: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.announcementbot.live/">Announcement Bot</a> - A <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> chatbot for custom announcements! It's supporting over 600 Discord servers!<br>
📫 How to reach me: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bubeez.dev/">Portfolio Site</a> | <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cwblount/">LinkedIn</a><br>
⚡ Fun fact: I was in the US Navy for ten years!
