### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects, both using Vue. One is a web app for the [Bulletheads gaming community](https://www.bulletheads.org/) and the other is a full-stack web dashboard for Announcement Bot users.<br>
âœ¨ My first side project: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.announcementbot.live/">Announcement Bot</a> - A <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> chatbot for custom announcements! It's supporting over 600 Discord servers!<br>
ðŸ“« How to reach me: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cwblount/">LinkedIn</a> or Email: bubbz (at) bubbz.dev<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I was in the US Navy for ten years!
